# MultiSource Translate: Enhancing Translation Quality Through Multi-Language Source Integration

## Introduction

This repository serves as a proposal aimed at improving the User Experience (UX) in multi-language services. 'MultiSource Translate' seeks to overcome the limitations of using a single source language by integrating and analyzing multiple source languages, thereby enhancing the quality of the target language translation.

### Note from the Author

This proposal is currently at the idea stage, and the author is not actively implementing or pursuing this project at this time.

## Problem Statement

Single source languages often fail to capture the full context and nuance of the text. For example, Korean has distinct formal (존댓말) and informal (반말) expressions that are difficult to fully capture with an English sentence alone. This issue is especially pertinent in fields like game localization, which require significant time and resources. Despite the availability of high-quality translation data for major languages (e.g., English, Chinese, Japanese), the quality of translations from Language A to Language B often remains inadequate.

## Proposed Solution

- Develop a translator that holistically analyzes multiple source languages (A, C, D, E, ...) to generate the final translation result.
- For a single translation task, multiple source languages containing the same content can be used as inputs to produce a new target language output. For instance, inputs in Language A (English) and Language B (Japanese) could produce an output in Language C (Korean).

## Final Usage Example

```
Input1: "The weather is nice today." (English)
Input2: "今日の天気はいいです。" (Japanese)
Output: "오늘 날씨가 좋아요." (Korean)
```

- Sentences with the same content in English and Japanese are provided as inputs.
- Through the use of multiple language inputs, a more accurate and natural translation in Korean is generated.

## Applicable Fields

This approach can be applied to any service that requires high-quality multi-language support. Specifically, the gaming industry, which often already has high-quality multi-language scripts, can utilize MultiSource Translate to more efficiently expand localization services into new languages.
